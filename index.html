        <p>
          The name of Arrah town is associated with goddess Aranya Devi. It is
          said that once there was a king named Moradhwaj, who was well known
          for his charity activities all over India. Though he was rich and
          happy he had one grief tormenting him. The reason for this torment was
          that he had no son. The King and the Queen fervently prayed to goddess
          Durga to bless them with a son. The goddess appeared to the king
          Moradhwaj in his dream and blessed him with a son. While the king were
          living happily, the king had a very shocking dream that Goddess Durga
          wished that the king and queen should stand before the altar along
          with their son in between them and they should ply the saw (Arrah)
          from the prince's head. The saw should be plied in such a way that the
          body of the boy gets split into two halves. It was also indicated in
          the dream that the king and queen should stand tearless while blood
          would flood the altar. The dream disturbed the king day and night and
          he disclosed it to his wife. As they were true devotees of goddess
          Durga, they decided to carry out her desire as she revealed in the
          dream. The prince on knowing this was not at all afraid. Rather, he
          felt happy to become a cause to fulfill the divine will. As the time
          of ordeal came, they all assembled before the altar of goddess Durga.
          When the king and the queen put the saw on the head of the prince the
          whole place was filled with soft glow of light and fragrance of
          flowers. Goddess Durga appeared in all her glory riding on a lion with
          a halo round her face and her hands were decorated with jewels and a
          crown of gold on her head. She blessed the couple and the prince for
          their undaunted devotion to her and then disappeared. According to
          myths, the place where the scene of the so-called sacrifice, came to
          be known as Arrah (saw). After which king Moradhwaj built a temple at
          Arrah in the name of goddess Durga. This temple is known today as
          Aranya Devi temple. Hundreds of worshippers and devotees flock the
          place daily.
